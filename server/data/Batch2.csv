I used to be part of the customer approver team with access to approve change requests on NZ accounts.
This seems to have been removed some time ago and I no longer have visibility of change requests or the ability to approve them.

There are flow on customer impacts as the primary changes that are made are relating to customer delivery days - and these are time sensitive.
Could I please be re-added to approve these?
I have attached an old screenshot of some old CRs that a colleague logged, which went to pending with customer approver team.

These reports, crucial for the team's operations, were last received on Tuesday of the previous week (17/10/2023). The issue required investigation into why the broadcasts had not been received as expected.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Investigate the cause of the broadcast failure: The team should look into why the broadcasts did not come through as scheduled. This could involve checking the system logs, settings, and any changes made recently.
2. Retrigger the failed broadcasts: As was done in a similar past issue (INC0041342), the team should attempt to retrigger the broadcasts. This could potentially resolve the issue if it was caused by a temporary system glitch.
3. Monitor the broadcasts: After retriggering, the team should closely monitor the broadcasts to ensure they are sent successfully.
4. Investigate high record numbers: If the broadcasts fail again, the team should investigate whether the number of records in the reports is too high, as this was the cause of failure in the past issue (INC0041342).
5. Seek further assistance if necessary: If the issue persists after these steps, it may be beneficial to seek further assistance from the C4C team, as they may have more specialized knowledge and tools to resolve the issue.

Please note that these recommendations are based on the information provided in the ticket and a similar past issue (INC0041342)."

Closing this incident on Michael's confirmation.,"ISSUE:
The ticket INC0046741 pertains to an issue with the SAP Manufacturing Integration Intelligence (MII) system on the Keg Line. Despite the line running, the system was still recording a downtime of 10 minutes at 10:02. The issue was assigned to the AM SAP MII team. The problem was that the filler was reporting states 1 and 16, which translate to Line Downtime and Outfeed Fault respectively. While the Line Downtime represented actual short stops, the Outfeed Fault did not stop production. The issue was resolved by the site's 3rd party support provider.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Update downtime events manually from the Manage Downtime dashboard as a workaround for this issue. This involves ticking the box at the left and then entering an end time after pressing the Edit button down the bottom.
2. Monitor the system for similar occurrences. If this issue happens frequently, further investigation and potential system improvements may be required.
3. Consider system performance optimization to prevent momentary system slowness, which could be causing the locking error.
4. Close the incident ticket, given the root cause has been identified and a workaround is in place.
5. Be aware that the next time the machine goes between 1 and 16 or any other non-running state, MII will interpret it as a new downtime event, so the process may need to be repeated until the cause of these ongoing outfeed faults is resolved.

The root cause was identified as a Goods Receipt (GR) that did not flow through successfully due to a posting period error at that time.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the resolution notes and additional comments, the following steps were taken to resolve the issue:

1. The AM team manually processed the Post Goods Issue (PGI) of the Outbound Deliveries (OBDs) so that the Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN) could be receipted.
2. The business was requested to provide a list of the pallets in an Excel format, as the team did not have authorization to view the file that the business had initially provided.
3. Upon receiving confirmation from the business that the deliveries had been Goods Receipted in SAP, and that the pallets had been scanned by the end of line drivers, the ticket was closed.

For future similar issues, the following steps are recommended:

1. Investigate and correct the SSCC scanning issues for the listed pallets to enable the warehouse to scan them.
2. Follow up with the MII team regarding the missed GR.
3. Retrigger some Handling Units (HUs) from the LAW team and have the MII team reprocess some HUs.
4. If further issues arise, a new ticket should be raised for investigation.

Please note that these recommendations are based on the information provided in the ticket and may require further investigation or clarification."

INC0046664,[BRQ][PO2-IUE2]OBD created for STO not flowing through to Warehouse Monitor for GI of materials,4 - Low,AM - SAP LAW,"Hi,
For STO 7403813810 we've created OBD 87941534 but it's not being distributed.  I think it's because the SLOC for the material isn't populated (it needs to be 1004), but when I try to put that via Change OBD, I get the error message that 0 of my material is available.
I have however already done the warehouse task to move the pallets into INB_STAGE, which should be 1004 in EWM but that doesn't show up in S4 (this is not unusual - I do a similar process regularly for stock write off's and while I've stopped checking it rarely if ever shows the stock in 1004 in the Display Stock screen).  
I can't find any stuck queues or any material mismatches between S4 and EWM, S4 just isn't showing the movement of the stock into 1004 which would I think allow me to update the OBD for it to distribute.
I vaguely remember being able to put the SLOC into the OBD in the past with the same process for other deliveries, but don't have documented evidence of this.
Thanks,
Sally",SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM),SAP,Enterprise Warehouse Management (EWM),"Root cause: STO 7403813810 was created with wrong sloc 1005 for the receiving plant boags. where it should be 1004  sloc for receiving in boags.

The ticket INC0046664 pertains to an issue with the distribution of Outbound Delivery (OBD) for Stock Transport Order (STO) 7403813810. The problem seems to be related to the Storage Location (SLOC) for the material not being populated. The user, Sally, attempted to update the SLOC to 1004 via Change OBD but received an error message indicating no available material. Despite completing the warehouse task to move the pallets into INB_STAGE, which should correspond to SLOC 1004 in EWM, this is not reflected in S4. Sally has not found any stuck queues or material mismatches between S4 and EWM. The root cause was identified as the STO 7403813810 being created with the wrong SLOC (1005) for the receiving plant boags, where it should have been 1004.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Delete Existing Delivery: The AM team needs to delete the existing delivery (87941534) to allow for the update of the SLOC in the STO.
2. Update SLOC in STO: The business needs to update the SLOC to 1004 in the STO.
3. Create New Delivery: After updating the SLOC in the STO, a new delivery (87949023) needs to be created.
4. Update SLOC in New Delivery: The SLOC needs to be updated to 1005 for the newly created delivery.
5. Regular Checks: Regular checks should be performed to avoid such issues in the future. This includes checking for any stuck queues or material mismatches between S4 and EWM.
6. Training: Sally may need further training or assistance to ensure the correct procedures are followed in the future.

This customer has several items on ""deal"" - all of their pack beer, cider and premix products.
When browsing those products the orange deal column is visible on the product tiles (as per screenshots)

However, when the customer is on the deals page, only 12 items come up.

I have checked the json to compare products in and out of the deals page and they are the identical conditions being used.
See attachments for the following comparison

3.  Made the config changes 
4. Informed user and verified in MP and we can now see all the deals.


Resolution - it was a solr config  limitation to the pricing search facet which was set to 500 only

The issue was specific to this customer as another customer with many products on deal displayed 111 items in the results. The problem was identified as a limitation in the Solr configuration for the pricing search facet, which was set to only 500.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
The resolution involved several steps:
1. The team first checked the marketplace and confirmed that the user had deals in the catalogue page but not on the deals page.
2. Upon further investigation, it was found that the issue was due to a Solr configuration limitation to the pricing search facet which was set to 500 only.
3. The team made the necessary configuration changes.

The ticket INC0046235 pertains to a problem with the SAP Manufacturing Integration Intelligence (MII) system. The issue was identified as a one-hour difference between the actual production time of a pallet on the Keg Line and the Goods Issue (GI) time in SAP. This discrepancy started from October 1, suggesting a potential relation to the start of Daylight Savings in New South Wales. The problem was causing difficulties in inventory control. The root cause was identified as the difference in time zones between the SAP server (Sydney time) and the plant (Brisbane time).

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The issue was investigated and replicated in the Test system (MITEMT), which behaved the same as the production system. This suggests that the current behavior is correct, as the SAP server is in Sydney time, which is one hour ahead of Brisbane time.
2. It is recommended to monitor the system behavior when daylight saving ends in April. If the GI time in MII and S4 shows the same after the end of Daylight Saving Time (DST), then the issue needs to be resolved.
3. If the issue persists, further investigation may be required, potentially involving adjustments to the system to account for the time difference.
4. In the meantime, it may be necessary to adjust operational procedures to account for the one-hour difference in time zones.
5. If no change can be made to align the system time with the actual time, the ticket can be closed as per the user's suggestion.

As there is no action pending from MII, closing this incident upon user confirmation.","ISSUE:
The ticket INC0045934 pertains to an issue with the SAP Manufacturing Integration Intelligence (MII) system, specifically with the Time Stealer not showing any downtime for over 24 hours. The problem was identified within the Data, Reporting & Analytics Products category. The issue was that the Time Stealer was not capturing data as the machine was running with a fault code. The machine in question was GL2PL01, which was in a HOLD state (16384), a state not correctly set up in the MII machine state model. In most cases, the machine was having a critical fault/warning but was still running. For the palletizer, the most likely issue was an air conditioning fault.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the information provided in the ticket and my understanding of the issue, the following steps are recommended:

1. Investigate the fault code that the machine is running with. This could involve checking the system logs or any error messages that were generated during this period.
2. Check the state of the machine (GL2PL01) in the MII machine state model. If the HOLD state (16384) is not set up correctly, this needs to be addressed.
3. Consult with the SAP MII team for further assistance, as they may have additional insights or troubleshooting methods to resolve the issue.
4. If the issue persists, consider escalating it to SAP support for a more in-depth investigation.
5. As a workaround, consider manually opening a downtime event from the Manage Downtime dashboard. Do not put an end time as it is still open as per historian. The next time MII receives a state change to close downtime from historian, it will complete the open downtime you have created.
6. Maintain open communication with the business, and arrange for a call if requested.

","ISSUE:
The ticket INC0045899 was raised due to an issue with the Concur profile of Geremy Arteaga, a NSW Sales Executive. The problem was that Geremy's expense claims were not being routed to the correct approver, Nancy Nikolov. Instead, they were being sent to Chris Lawler for approval. This issue was identified when Chris Lawler received Geremy's expenses for approval. The ticket was categorized under Data Reporting & Analytics Products and assigned to the AM Concur group.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the resolution notes, the issue was resolved by confirming that Nancy Nikolov is indeed Geremy's leader in his Concur profile and that the claims are correctly routing to her. It was found that due to Nancy's approval expiring, the expenses were temporarily routed to Chris Lawler. After this was clarified, no further action was required and the ticket was closed. 

Steps breakdown:
1. Identify the issue with the Concur profile and the incorrect routing of expense claims.
2. Confirm the correct leader (Nancy Nikolov) in Geremy's Concur profile.
3. Check the routing of the expense claims to ensure they are going to the correct leader.
4. If the claims are not routing correctly, investigate the cause (in this case, Nancy's approval had expired).
5. Once the issue is resolved, confirm with the ticket raiser (Chris Lawler) and ask for permission to close the ticket.

Please note that these recommendations are based on the resolution provided in the ticket and the steps from the knowledge base document ""How to approve Expense Claim as a delegate""."

Steps taken to resolve the issue :
1. Issue here is with customer unable to see their favorites in the Marketplace.
2. This is a known issue, as it is because of the exclusion conditions or the products being removed by business. So, one of the Wishlist entry product turns to be null/empty.
So because of it in the front end favorites are not being visible.
3. We had already suggested a CI for the fix of this issue to business.
4. As a workaround, we search in Backoffice in the Customer Wishlist for a null product and delete them manually.
5. We also have a query where we run it and delete those NULL Pk manually in Hybris Backoffice
6. Informed user on the same and got confirmation that favorites list are now visible for Customer.


Resolution - Issue was resolved by following the above steps","ISSUE:
The ticket INC0045897 was raised by Gurinder Singh, a Digital Support Executive at Lion Digital, on behalf of Pineapple Hotel Kangaroo Point (10104406). The customer reported that their favorites folder, named ""Pineapple"", which contained around 30 SKUs, had disappeared from the Marketplace on the SAP Hybris eCommerce platform. The issue was assigned to the AM Hybris eComm group and was categorized as a low priority under SAP.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
The issue was resolved by following these steps:

1. The team identified that the customer was unable to see their favorites in the Marketplace. This was a known issue, often caused by exclusion conditions or products being removed by the business, resulting in one of the Wishlist entry products turning null/empty and making the favorites invisible on the front end.

2. The team had previously suggested a Continuous Improvement (CI) fix for this issue to the business.

3. As a workaround, the team searched in Backoffice in the Customer Wishlist for a null product and deleted them manually. They also ran a query to delete these NULL Pk manually in Hybris Backoffice.

4. The user was informed of the steps taken and confirmed that the favorites list was now visible for the customer.

5. The team had also created an automatic report to fetch all the NA or null products from the Wishlist and send it to the business. The business would then provide Replacement SKUs, which the team would replace accordingly. This job was set to run every few days.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the resolution notes and historical tickets, the following steps are recommended:

1. Review the MTO Strategy: The issue might be due to the MTO Strategy maintained in the Time-series Location Product master data. This strategy could be causing the discrepancy in the forecast and the actual stock deployment.

2. Raise a Change Incident (CI): The user, Lorika, is advised to raise a CI to separate Time Series and Response behaviour. This could help in resolving the inconsistency between the forecast and the actual stock deployment.

3. Provide Screenshots: The user should provide screenshots once the plan is published this week. These screenshots could provide further insights into the issue and help in its resolution.

4. Await User Feedback: The ticket was set on hold until the user provides the screenshots. Once the screenshots are provided, further investigation can be carried out based on the additional information.

1. The resolution provided explains that even though the contract type is Indirect, the condition type ZC30/YC30 is part of direct volume pricing (i.e., orders, credit requests, etc.). Therefore, the accrual will be done in the direct volumes as well.
2. The accrued value in the direct volume would then be reversed when the next delta accrual is executed.
3. The team proceeded to close the incident, but they advised the user to reach out or raise a new incident in case of any further issues.
4. The user was also encouraged to respond back to the survey generated upon ticket closure to help improve the service to the business.

The ticket INC0045790 was raised due to an issue with an Advance Shipping Notice (ASN) in the SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) system. The problem was that two lines needed to be deleted from a partially completed ASN so that the Inbound Delivery (IBD) could be closed. The two pallets associated with these lines were damaged in transit and could not be unloaded, hence they needed to be removed from the ASN. The ASN in question was 805153046 and the IBD was 0184049239. The material involved was 1260131 and the lines to be deleted were 310 and 320. Both lines were showing as partially completed with Goods Receipt (GR), unloading, and putaway all not started.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Investigate the reason behind the inability to delete the lines from the ASN. It could be due to the pallets being damaged in transit or there could be other underlying issues.
2. Once the issue is identified, take the necessary steps to rectify it. This could involve adjusting the settings of the ASN or modifying the control cycles.
3. After the issue is resolved, attempt to delete the lines from the ASN again. If successful, proceed with the GR.
4. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to a higher level of technical support or consulting with the software vendor.
5. In this case, the AM team cancelled the line items 310 and 320 from the IBD 0184049239410002629547 and the state of GR and putaway are complete.

Please note that these recommendations are based on the information provided in the ticket and my understanding of typical ASN and GR processes. They may need to be adjusted based on the specific systems and processes in use at your organization."

Customer placed the order via Marketplace on 10 Oct at 10.14AM (before their cut off) so the order should therefore have dated for delivery on 12 Oct.
Instead, it dated for 19 Oct.
Please investigate why this didn't default to 12 Oct as expected.",SAP S4 Order to Cash (O2C),SAP,Order to Cash (O2C),Closed by Caller,"ISSUE:
The issue pertains to a customer who placed an order (12813423) via Marketplace on 10th October at 10:14 AM, which was before their cut-off time. The order should have been dated for delivery on 12th October. However, it was incorrectly dated for 19th October. The system's dating logic did not work as expected for this order. The factory calendar ID currently in use for this customer is W0, which has workdays from Monday to Friday. Therefore, after creating an order from Sunday after the cut-off, it will be plus 2 days which is Monday then Tuesday.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Investigate the dating logic for orders placed before the cut-off time. The system should be able to correctly date the orders for the following Tuesday if the order is placed before the cut-off time on Sunday.
2. Check the factory calendar ID (W0) settings. If the customer has a Tuesday delivery, the calendar settings should reflect this.
3. If necessary, adjust the factory calendar ID settings to ensure that they align with the customer's delivery schedule.
4. Test the updated settings to ensure that the dating logic works correctly for future orders.
5. Communicate the changes to the relevant stakeholders to avoid confusion in the future.
6. As per the additional comments, it seems that the delivery date logic in the Hybris system is set to ""today+1"" behavior, which might be causing the issue. This needs to be investigated and adjusted if necessary.

The ticket with the number INC0045725 pertains to an alert triggered from ORIGIN OMi, under the category Linux and subcategory AWS. The alert was triggered on 15th October 2023 at 04:32:57 EST. The issue was related to the inode usage on the server syavsapase01lionaws, specifically the ALR ALR4ICP2 InodessybaseIUse, which was at 92%. The environment affected was PRD and the alert was of low priority (4). The business application impacted was SAP Identity Management (IDM) and the assignment group handling this issue was AM SAP Basis. The issue was due to sybase in syavsapase01 idm core dev being nearly 100% utilized. However, no business impact was reported.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the resolution notes and work notes, the following steps can be taken:

1. Continue monitoring the sybase in syavsapase01 idm core dev, as it is nearly 100% utilized.
2. No cleanup action can be done so far since S4 Security is still unable to cleanup objects in IDM dev.
3. Despite the high inode usage on sybase, no issues have been observed so far in IDM dev. Therefore, the team should continue monitoring IDM Dev.

Additionally, based on my own knowledge and the information provided in the ticket, the following steps could be considered:

4. Identify the tables in CSD that are taking up significant disk space.
5. Evaluate the importance of the data in these tables and determine if it can be safely deleted or archived.
6. Perform the cleanup operation to free up disk space.
7. Monitor the server to ensure that the cleanup has resolved the issue and that the file system usage is back to normal levels.

The alert was associated with the ciHint syaphybadm02lionawssyaphybadm02lionaws in the PRD environment.

However, upon investigation, it was found that the usage of Admin 2 was at 66%, which is below the threshold. As a result, the priority of the alert was downgraded to low (Priority 4), and the ticket was closed.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the information provided and general best practices, the following steps are recommended:

1. Implement a system to automatically alert the team when usage approaches the threshold. This will allow for proactive management of the filesystem usage.
2. Regularly archive and delete unnecessary files to maintain optimal filesystem usage. This can help prevent the filesystem usage from reaching high levels.
3. Consider expanding storage capacity if the current usage trends continue. This can help accommodate higher usage levels without triggering alerts.
4. Regularly monitor the usage of Admin 2 to ensure it remains below the threshold. This can help prevent unnecessary alerts and ensure the system is functioning within acceptable limits.

Please note that these recommendations are generated based on the information provided and general best practices. For more specific actions, further investigation into the issue might be required."

The issue was identified as an error in creating an invoice for the order. The data was missing in the ACDOCA table for this sales order, which led to the absence of revenue data in the report.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Request the business to provide data extract up to the document number level for comparison. This data should be validated by the Order to Cash (O2C) team.
2. Analyze the values of the list price in S4 versus what is seen in AFO for August to determine any discrepancies.
3. Confirm how the values on the Year-to-Date (YTD) current financial amount and YTD Current financial Quantity are being determined. This could help understand why the quantity for August is very little, causing discrepancies on the price list.
4. Coordinate with the Reporting & Analytics (RAA) team for any required details for further checks.
5. Continue the investigation to identify any variances between the source ACDOCA values and the report.
6. If no action is needed from Record to Report (R2R), consider reassigning the ticket to O2C.
7. Upon resolution, request feedback from the business to help improve the service.
8. The issue might be due to an error while creating an invoice for the order. The project team was checking the issue. Once it has been released to accounting, the data should be available in ACDOCA and AFO.

INC0045450,[BRQ] [DP04-IUE1] Query about snapshot KFs,4 - Low,AM - SAP P2M,"What's the purpose of these jobs, and why do we run on Wednesday & Sunday?
- ZBA SP Weekly Snapshots Wednesday
- ZBA SP Weekly Redo Snapshots Sunday

I was investigating the snapshot KF's that it populates, but there seems to be an issue with the most recent snapshots. 

For example:
ZSCSSPRODUCTION_SS_1
ZSCSSPRODUCTION_SS_2
Both seem to contain the same data, not 1 and 2 weeks ago.

All of the snapshots are therefore not X weeks ago, as would be expected.

Could you please have a look and let me know?",SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP),SAP,Integrated Business Planning (IBP),"Resolution details: Will be taken over by the project team as a CI.
RFC# N/A","ISSUE:
The ticket INC0045450 was raised due to a query about snapshot Key Figures (KFs) in the SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP) system. The user was investigating the purpose of the jobs ""ZBA SP Weekly Snapshots Wednesday"" and ""ZBA SP Weekly Redo Snapshots Sunday"" and why they run on Wednesday and Sunday respectively. The user noticed an issue with the most recent snapshots, specifically ""ZSCSSPRODUCTION_SS_1"" and ""ZSCSSPRODUCTION_SS_2"", which seemed to contain the same data, not representing 1 and 2 weeks ago as expected. The user requested a review of this issue.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The issue will be taken over by the project team as a Continuous Improvement Request (CIR). 
2. The Wednesday and Sunday snapshot jobs were set up to capture the NZ and AU supply planning results respectively. However, since the jobs have been reverted back to snapshot operator, the flexibility to separate out the snapshots using filters has been lost. 
3. A potential solution could be to revert back to copy operators, but issues previously encountered with this approach would need to be addressed.
4. The snapshot jobs for AU and NZ could be separated for clarity. The steps in the Application job could be correctly named to indicate the copying process from ""_1"" to ""_2"", etc. 
5. A new Key Figure could be created to represent the current week, such as ""_0"", or guidance could be provided on which Key Figure meets that purpose.
6. The situation should be monitored, particularly after the next Sunday run to check if the week gets populated by the job before proceeding with the copy operator changes.
7. The user should be informed of any updates and further concerns should be addressed promptly.

Please note that these recommendations are based on the information provided in the ticket and may need to be adjusted based on further investigation or changes in the situation."

The ticket INC0045441 pertains to an issue with the Dependent Production Demand Snapshot not populating in the Material Price Roll Up template in the SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP) system. The problem was identified with the 12503 Sales Plan Dependent Production Demand Snapshot volumes. Despite running the job ""ZBA AU SOP Lock Supply Plan Output and Create PlanObj for COGS Var in Monthly Work - NEW"", the volumes were still not populating. The issue was impacting the visibility of the Dependent Production Demand, which is only visible on the Base Version, and therefore, when the job was run, it did not copy over to the Snapshot Key Figure on the Monthly Work Version.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Run the jobs ""ZBA AU Copy Version - Dependent Production Demand - Baseline to Monthly Work Ad Hoc"" and ""ZBA AU SOP Lock Supply Plan Output and Create PlanObj for COGS Var in Monthly Work - NEW"". These jobs should help in populating the Dependent Production Demand Snapshot in the Material Price Roll Up template.
2. Identify who in the workflow is responsible for loading the pricing. This seems to be a crucial step in getting the product to show in the Plan.
3. Work on maintaining the pricing information for the affected material. This task has been agreed upon by Shelley, Rohit, and the team.
4. Ensure that the workflow area showing complete is indeed complete and not missing any crucial steps or information.

The issue was assigned to the AM - Hybris Marketing and C4C group and was categorized under Sales and Marketing Products with a priority level of 4 (Low).

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the resolution notes and additional comments, the following steps were likely taken to resolve the issue:

1. The user, Sean, was asked to confirm the steps he took to load the promotional notes.
2. It was identified that the user should have selected the hierarchy node on the Account Type field instead of Account. This was likely causing the field team to be unable to view the notes.
3. Sean was advised to correct this by selecting the appropriate option.
4. After making the necessary changes, Sean was asked to delete and create the promotional notes again.

2. If the order is still appearing in the report despite being completed, investigate the discrepancy between the two systems.
3. The AM team resolved the issue by updating the LAW Interface report through the dt_pal table with the delivery 87883916 and updating the status. This step could be replicated for similar issues in the future.

Preethi Jayakumar ",SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM),SAP,Logistics and Warehousing (LAW),"Root cause: Stuck queue error for PU order qty exceeded for these two IBD's 183983612, 183985129. in PO 7500313044.
Resolution: AM team informed business to update qty 2,28,752 in  STO 7500313044 for line item 10. Now queue got cleared by increasing the quantity in STO.
","ISSUE:
The issue pertains to a stuck queue for IBDs 183983612 and 183985129 in the SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) system. The problem arose due to the IBD quantity exceeding the Purchase Order (PO) quantity. Specifically, the IBDs were created against line item 10 of PO 7500313044, which has three IBDs against it. One of these IBDs (183984600) has been completed, but the other two (183983612 and 183985129) have a stuck queue because their quantities are more than the PO quantity. The error message is ""PU Ordered quantity exceeded by 36608 EA"".

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
The recommended solution is to validate the IBDs 183983612 and 183985129 and update the quantity of PO 7500313044. Specifically, the PO quantity for line item 10 should be increased to 228752. This action needs to be taken by the business. Once the PO quantity is updated in the system, it should resolve the stuck queue issue. 

Steps breakdown:
1. Validate the IBDs 183983612 and 183985129.
2. Update the quantity for line item 10 in the Stock Transport Order (STO) 7500313044 to 228752.
3. Confirm that the stuck queue is cleared after the update.

This mismatch was causing data in the order series to appear in the previous week when copied from the time series. Additionally, most of the job templates were using the UTC timezone, which caused the scheduled time for jobs to shift by one hour post daylight savings. The request was to align the TS time profiles with the OS and to change all job templates to use the AEST timezone to avoid this issue.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Apply a period shift in the copy operator: This was the temporary workaround that was implemented to address the issue. Given the potential data inconsistencies that could arise from changing the time buckets in the time series of the time profile, this workaround should be made permanent.
2. Change job templates to use AEST timezone: To avoid the issue of scheduled job times shifting by one hour post daylight savings, all job templates should be changed to use the AEST timezone.
3. Close the OSS call: An OSS call was logged to understand potential issues with changing the time buckets in the time series of the time profile. Given SAP's advice not to proceed with this change, this call can now be closed.

However, the consolidated invoice flag was updated to 'Y' on 05/10/2023, which is after the orders were processed. This could be the reason why the orders were not consolidated.

The issue pertains to ticket INC0044813, where ASN 2294 related to a delivery from WestRock was not flowing. The problem arose because two of the 22 pallets should not have been included in this ASN as this material needed to be Goods Receipted (GR'd) indirectly. This issue was preventing the other 20 pallets from being GR'd as per the normal process.

1. The Goods Receipt was manually created as the supplier could not amend the ASN.
2. It is recommended to avoid manual deletions of line items in STOs to prevent such issues in the future.

As per attached email from Dilyara Badyrova, as long as the PO tax data is correct, it will copy to the invoice and supplier shouldn't have to manually select tax code when creating the invoice in Ariba portal. This inconvenient was raised by Rhea from Interpack in Sep 2023.",SAP Ariba onDemand,SAP,Ariba,Activated the Ariba rules: Copy tax from PO to standard invoice for Interpack supplier group.,"ISSUE:
The ticket INC0044602 pertains to a request to activate Ariba rules to copy tax from Purchase Order (PO) to standard invoice for the supplier group Interpack. This request was made to ensure that as long as the PO tax data is correct, it will be copied to the invoice, eliminating the need for the supplier to manually select the tax code when creating the invoice in the Ariba portal. This issue was raised by Rhea from Interpack in September 2023.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Activate the Ariba rules to copy tax from PO to standard invoice for the Interpack supplier group. This will ensure that the correct tax data from the PO is automatically copied to the invoice.
2. Review the configuration of the Ariba Network. If an Ariba Network buyer account has been enabled to generate PDF invoice copies, it should automatically generate digitally signed PDF invoices in a custom format after a supplier creates an invoice.
3. Check the requirements for digitally signed invoices in the relevant countries. SAP Ariba buyer administrators can configure Ariba Network to receive either the digitally signed copies of the standard template invoices or custom PDF invoices.
4. Review the article KB0405066 on SAP's help page for assistance on why this information is appearing.
5. Raise a Service Request (SR) to Ariba regarding the issue of ""Not a tax invoice"" triggering for some invoices.
6. Ensure all invoices state ""Tax Invoice"" as per legislative requirements.

Cheers, Will Holmes",SAP Cloud for Customer (C4C),Sales & Marketing Products,Cloud for Customer (C4C),"Issue : Unable to view ISM tickets
Resolution : Added to territories and updated categorization schema for credit tickets","ISSUE:
The user, Will Holmes, was experiencing issues with viewing ISM tickets in the SAP Cloud for Customer (C4C) system. Despite receiving screenshots from other users, Will could only see some of the logged tickets, not all. This issue was causing problems for him. The ticket was categorized under Sales & Marketing Products and was assigned to the AM - Hybris Marketing and C4C group.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the information provided, the following steps were taken to resolve the issue:

1. Identify the issue: Will was unable to view all ISM tickets in the C4C system.
2. Understand the cause: Access to tickets is based on territories assigned to the user. Will was only assigned to the NZ territory, while other users, like Marija, were assigned to both AU and NZ territories. Additionally, Marija had a Sales Operations business role, which provided read access to all C4C tickets.
3. Implement the solution: Will was added to the AU territories to expand his access. The categorization schema for credit tickets was also updated as it was found to be causing the issue.
4. Confirm the resolution: Will was asked to validate the changes on his end. Upon confirmation from Will, the ticket was closed.

Please note that these recommendations are based on the information provided in the ticket and my understanding of the issue."

The ticket INC0044131 pertains to an issue with the SAP Manufacturing Integration Intelligence (MII) system at the XXXX Milton Site. The problem was that the filler speed on the GL1S12 Filler was being recorded incorrectly. The filler was running at approximately 54k, but it was registering at 129480k, which was affecting the overall results. The issue was categorized under Data Reporting & Analytics Products and was assigned to the AM SAP MII group. The priority level for this ticket was low.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Validate the Numbers: The numbers displayed are aligned with the historian data and are the expected numbers if the filler is running at full speed. Therefore, no fix is needed for this incident.
2. Monitor the System: A separate system that monitors the filler speed agrees with the numbers in the historian. This system has previously validated the reject number recordings during the commissioning of the machine for each of the error cases.
3. Understand the Data: The chart is showing an instantaneous speed. Looking at the MPM_PROD_RUN_DATA table, it appears that the 1037 data point has been missed, so the 1038 point is in fact the sum of 1037 and 1038. This is reflected in the EFFEC_DURATION field.
4. Close the Incident: As the numbers displayed in the chart are expected numbers and aligned with the historian, the incident can be closed.

1. Review the authorization settings in ChaRM: The issue seems to be related to the authorization in ChaRM, which currently only allows the Basis Team to move ChaRMs to the test environment.
2. Implement planned change CHG0034692: There was a planned change (CHG0034692) mentioned in the ticket, which seems to be aimed at resolving this issue. This change should be implemented as planned.
3. Confirm implementation and test: Once the change has been implemented, it should be confirmed with the Security Team. Following this, users should test the functionality to ensure that they can now move their own transports to the Test system.

Can you please investigate why changing the default address for an account via Marketplace doesn't change the default ship-to in S4?

Cheers,

The ticket INC0043276, with a low priority, was raised concerning an issue with the SAP Master Data Governance (MDG) system.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Investigate the integration between the Marketplace and the S4 system to identify any issues that might be preventing the update of the default ""ship-to"" address.
2. Check the synchronization process between the two systems to ensure that changes made in the Marketplace are correctly reflected in the S4 system.
3. Review the specific example provided (GG Wellington Hutt Rd and Glengarry Wines) for any anomalies that might have caused the issue.

The ticket INC0043003 was raised due to an old pallet in the SAP S4 Logistics and Warehousing (LAW) system that did not have an associated Inbound Delivery (IBD).

2. The AM team resolved the issue by ghosting the pallet.

 ","ISSUE:
The ticket INC0042993 pertains to a request for a change in the way promo fund orders are currently working in the SAP S4 Order to Cash (O2C) system. The user wants the budget remaining to be based on the accrual balance rather than being an upper limit for putting through promo orders. This is specifically for ZPMP CCIDs. The issue was identified as a need for a change in the logic of the promotion order delivery block reason.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Recognize the Change as a Continuous Improvement (CI): The new requirement falls under CI. Jyoti will discuss with Carlo and Samantha to take it ahead.
2. Business Justification for the Change: The change is justified as it will avoid manual updating of CCID, saving time. It will also ensure customers receive bonus stock quicker, avoiding delay times. When an order is blocked, sales currently have to raise a ticket to increase the budget of the CCID.
3. Raise a CI: As discussed in the call, the team should help raise a CI to implement the required changes.
4. Close the Incident: The team is proceeding to close this incident. In case of any issues, the user can ping the team or raise a new incident.
5. Schedule a Discussion: As per Joe's request, a calendar block is being set up to discuss the requirements of the subject incident.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the resolution notes and the attached ""How to Raise a Pricing Credit Service"" guide, the following steps should be taken:

1. Calculate the expected pricing: Export the data for the first order and the rekeyed order. Identify the line items where the pricing differs and calculate the difference. This will be the amount due for crediting.

2. Raise a complaint/credit request: Use the ""Complaint Guided Creation - Debit/Credit Request"" feature in the system. Enter the invoice number of the rekeyed order (Order 2) as the reference and select the billing document and items that need a pricing credit.

3. Enter the complaint details: Provide a description and select the appropriate category and credit reason.

4. Enter Resolution Notes: After creating the complaint, edit it to add resolution notes.

5. Create an Invoice Correction/Credit: Use the ""Invoice Correction/Credit"" feature to create a correction for each line item that needs a credit. Enter the condition type and the amount due for crediting for each line item.

6. Verify and finalize: Ensure that the Net Value equals the amount due for crediting. If correct, finalize the process.

Can we please do three things:
- Confirm what S4/IBP data feeds into LocationTo Source (Ie SPK or LocationSource)
- If we purge location to source data (delete all) will it get reloaded on Wednesday night master data load. Can we please test in QA/E2E to see if the data comes back. 
- Can we please mass delete the attached combinations, as a starting point? These are the easiest to identify as being unnecessary.

This discrepancy led to a stock out situation as the Material Planner was misled by the incorrect stock data, believing there was more stock on site than there actually was.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the resolution notes and additional comments, the following steps were taken and are recommended for similar issues in the future:

1. Update changes in the TEST ENVIRONMENT: Changes were made in the test environment to address the issue. It is recommended to always test changes in a controlled environment before implementing them in production.

2. Complete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) document: The UAT document is crucial for verifying the changes made in the test environment. The business user was asked to complete the UAT document once they returned from leave.

3. Address known issue in Stock Transport Orders (STOs): The integration failure was due to a known issue in STOs where delivery dates should not have different dates. However, due to a split in Bevchain, different delivery dates were given. This issue needs to be addressed to prevent similar problems in the future.

4. Correct Outbound Deliveries (OBDs): Incorrect OBDs were identified and corrected. This involved updating the Job Id in the LIONLAW_DT_PAL table view, removing incorrect OBDs, and saving the changes. The OBDs were then input in the VL02N transaction, the picked quantity and batch were updated, and the goods issue was posted.

The ticket INC0042354 pertains to a credit variance between a credit and an invoice in the SAP S4 Order to Cash (O2C) system. The invoice amount was 663590 while the credit amount was 663200. The issue was identified as being due to the ZOE1 discount condition type in unplanned returns, which was calculating only on the credit memo. This was because the current design of the system was using the delivery as a reference when creating unplanned returns, not the invoice.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upon investigation, it was advised to the business to raise a service request for enhancement as the variance was happening due to ZOE1 applying only in the Credit memo. This is because it is designed to reference the delivery document instead of the Invoice.
2. The business was provided with the investigation results and advised to raise a service request for the fix as it falls under NSSR.
3. The issue is due to the current design where unplanned returns are using Delivery as a reference but not the Invoice. If this needs to be changed, a service request should be raised where approval from SDMs can be requested to proceed with changes.
4. The ABAP team was consulted to understand why Z0E1 is not applied on the Credit memo. The issue was found to be with all unplanned returns with condition type ZOE1. Full Pallet Discount Z0E1 is not applied in Standard order Invoice and Unplanned returns but applied in Credit invoice.

INC0042336,[BRQ][APP3-IDT1]Production issue: Product Category data in Hybris,4 - Low,AM - Hybris eComm,"The name/ID of some Categories in Hybris are not following the design.

The issue was noticed in the NZ site, when a user selects a Brand or a filter in the Product Listing page. 
We have seen this before and I think maybe it was resolved for the other categories but not this one?

1. There are two Categories sharing the same name. This is causing issues when using the filters in Marketplace, as there is no way to identify which of the two categories have been selected:

This happens when:

• Navigating via Products > Shop all merchandise
• In catalogue, filtering by Category > Merchandise

In the Hybris Shop, the two categories are presented as main categories, however when selecting the first one (with 488 items) then the second ""Merchandise"" appears as a subcategory (with 140 items). Is this mapping incorrectly assigned? 

Refer to images attached.


2. There is inconsistency between the name and the ID of the ""Premix"" category. All other categories follow the same rule, where the ID and the name is the same. This is obvious when a customer selects ""Premix"" in the filters, but the result actually show up as ""Ready to Drink"". Can the names be aligned?

This was obvious when a customer selects Premix in the filters but the result actually show up as Ready to Drink.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
The issue was investigated and found to be due to duplicate Merchandise data setup in the backend, causing it to show up twice in categories and in facet filters. The issue was fixed in the TEST environment and the user was asked for validation. Once confirmation is received, a Change Request (CR) will be raised to move the fixes to Production. The steps taken to resolve the issue were as follows:

1. Identified the issue with the category data setup in Hybris.
2. Found that the issue was due to duplicate Merchandise data setup in the backend.

Hi Steve,
Your active work email is Steven.Walker2@lionco.com.  Your points are sitting under Steven.Walker2@lionco.com as well.
I had a chat with Gurinder and he also confirmed that your access is set-up under Steven.Walker2@lionco.com.  However, there may be an issue in your contact details (please screenshot below) wherein your email is still showing as Steven.Walker@lionco.com instead of Steven.Walker2@lionco.com.  Thus, when you access Marketplace the exchange defaults to the incorrect address.
As this is outside of payroll scope, I suggest you raise an IT General Request via ServiceNow.  I tried raising one for you but Steven Walker and Steven Charles Walker cannot be found from my end.  It might be better that the ticket will be raised directly by yourself.
I will now close this ticket as payroll does not have the visibility nor the access regarding your email set-up.
  
 
 
 
Regards,
Tania

The ticket INC0042038 was raised due to an issue with Order 12749030 in the SAP S4 Order to Cash (O2C) system. The order did not go through the cut-off process as expected. Part of the order went on to back order cancellation, however, no Outbound Delivery (OBD) was created and manual creation of OBD was also not possible. The issue was investigated to determine the cause.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Upon investigation, it was found that the delivery was not created because the document was blocked by another job or user. 
2. The error log confirmed that no jobs specific to this were running at the time. 
3. The likely cause for the delivery not being created by the job before cut-off could be because the document was locked by another user. However, there was no log available to identify who that was.
4. The issue was resolved by correcting the recipe and reversing the earlier lot. 
5. Moving forward, it is recommended to ensure that documents are not locked by other users or jobs during the cut-off process to prevent similar issues. 
6. The ticket was closed following the resolution of the issue.

1. The resolution provided advises the user to update the Freight list to '000' for order reason '103 - CRDDBT Transfer of goods' in the ZFFS condition type. This change will prevent the calculation of freights for Transfer of Goods (TOG).
2. Testing was conducted in a lower environment to confirm that maintaining the new ZFFS condition with respect to Order reason - Transfer of Goods is working as expected.

The ticket INC0041083 was raised due to an issue with certain returns not automatically resolving upon receipt of stock in the SAP S4 Order to Cash (O2C) system. The returns in question are 9000157607, 9000198851, and 9000195609. All three returns have the same credit reason - ADR Customer Return NonInvoiced Stock. Despite all product returns being fully receipted with customer resolution communications notes completed, they remained in the released status. The issue was identified as the absence of a credit memo created for advance returns, which is a new configuration where the refund code is 0 and the complaint should resolve after goods movement is completed.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The user agreed to raise a Change Initiative (CI) for the issue. This step is crucial as it will help address the problem and implement necessary changes.
2. A discussion was held with the Business Lisa and O2C functional Lead Ellys Sie, confirming that this fix/change will fall as a CI.
3. It was noted that complaints which have a return order, return delivery, and respective credit memo resolve automatically. However, the complaint mentioned in the ticket does not have a credit memo, hence it cannot be resolved automatically.
4. For complaints that need to be resolved, sample documents were provided for reference.
5. It was clarified that for ADR returns of non-invoiced stock, which were not invoiced, no credit memo should be created.
6. It was recommended to check if any credit memo was raised or if this is normal. Based on standard logic, advance return complaints get resolved once return delivery and credit memo is completed.

We would like to appreciate if you can response back to the Survey generated upon ticket closure to help us in improving the service to the business.","ISSUE:
The ticket INC0036731 pertains to an issue with the reversal of over accrual on ZPAD CCIDs in the SAP S4 Revenue (REV) system. The previous solution to reverse 91 million resulted in issues in paying customer rebates. The problem was identified in 740 customer CCIDs and was related to a historical data issue. The issue was assigned to the AM SAP REV group and was given a low priority. The problem was also linked to another incident, INC0036635, and a previous solution was referred to in INC0024516.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
The resolution involved creating a problem request (PRB0040412) to track the status until the business performs the suggested solution. The steps taken were as follows:

1. Investigate the historical data issue and understand why the CCIDs are erroring out when the Z5PI documents were generated.
2. Identify that the values of the over accruals are coming from the accounting and not from the CCIDs, causing issues whenever a final settlement manual document is posted.
3. Propose two options to fix the issue:
   a. Option 1: Businesses can create FI upload files (LIONFI_GPUPLOAD) using the combination of the GL account 2043000 for CCID 2000078553 and transferring to GL account 4102000 having a combination of customer/material.
   b. Option 2: If option 1 is not applicable from the business side, opt for option 2 which involves moving the values from affected CCID to placeholder CCID (positive value), creating JV document with returns, rerunning the last dated delta accrual, creating JV document with standard, and creating Auto final settlement document.
4. Request for time until Monday to execute a few scenarios in a lower environment to understand the behavior of the proposed solution.

2. It was found that several jobs running in EMP related to condition contracts are normal jobs that regularly run without any issues.
3. Most of the processing time is spent on the database, with no issues found on the database. The issue seems to be isolated to reading condition contracts.
4. There is slowness when accessing table WB2_CDS_CCS_ACCRUALS_. 
5. As per SAP advice, the tiles are working slow sometimes because of memory issues. This issue will be brought to SDM note.

The ticket INC0029808 was raised due to inconsistencies between the data in SuccessFactors (updated data) and S4 (old data), which was causing issues in downstream systems like Concur. The problem was identified in the SuccessFactors business application and was assigned to the AM SAP H2R team. The issue was categorized under Integration Products. The request was for IT support to check the integration as it could not be checked/fixed by the PC team that manages SuccessFactors.

","RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The resolution for this issue involved confirming that there was no integration problem between SuccessFactors and SAP. The team was resolving leader issues and hence decided to close the ticket.
2. The Integration team checked and found two standard SAP interfaces in CPI for SF to S4 integration: ""Replicate Employee Master Data and Org Assignments from SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central to SAP ERP or SAP S4HANA"" and ""Replicate Organizational Objects from SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central to SAP ERP or SAP S4HANA"".
3. The team suggested that since these are standard interfaces, they can only validate the data coming from SF to S4 by enabling the trace in CPI. This needs to be informed to the integration team before the data sync.
4. The team recommended reaching out to SAP for further support since these are standard interfaces.
5. The team requested the user to review the proposed solution and confirm if the issue has been resolved so that the ticket can be closed.
